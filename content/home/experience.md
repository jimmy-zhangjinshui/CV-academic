  **Duties**
  * Teaching Assistance on the lectures of Fundamental Power Electronics and Academic English
  * Research on the cause and solution of current zero-crossing distortion of the Totem-Pole PFC rectifier
  * Research on the non-linear characteristics of powdered iron core inductors. Specifically, he applied amplitude modulation property to analyze how their saturation feature influences the current harmonics distribution, and accordingly he proposed an aoptimal variable switching frequency scheme to restrain this effect and thus to reduce the margin for magnetic saturation in the design. Therefore, the volume of the inductors can be shrunk and the power density is improved.
  * Research on the optimization of resonant tank parameters of LLC converter.
