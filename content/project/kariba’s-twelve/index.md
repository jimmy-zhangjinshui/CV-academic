  Nowadays, the Kariba Dam situation deserves attention.

  There are three possible options to address the problem: repairing, rebuilding and replacing it with a series of smaller dams along the Zambezi river. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each option and further we analyze the third option thoroughly.

  Firstly, in view of the rules for constructing a dam, we select dam placement and make adjustment. We obtain initial placement of smaller dams based on the water level difference along the Zambezi River. Then we draw sectional view of river course of each initial placement. According to the rules, we make slight adjustment to the initial placement and get the final position.

  Secondly, the process of dynamic change of water surface can be very complicated when the dam is sluicing, so we decide to deal with the problem with the discretization method. We build a mathematical model to obtain water level of all region according to the states of each dam.

  Thirdly, we measure the safety and costs of the strategy in terms of maintenance cost and generated electrical energy. Then we estimate our strategy with the two indicators based the data. Compared with the previous Kariba Dam, these new smaller dams each is considered into two states: open for sluice on, close for sluice off. Then, we define dam state as a variable and use Zero-One programming algorithm method to build a model with consideration of safety and costs. Since there are only ten to twenty dams built along the river, we find it reasonable to apply exhaustion method to our model. So we can get the optimal control strategy under normal climate conditions.

  Besides, we can also apply our model to deal with the problem under extreme conditions and make several successive modification strategies with short duration.

  At last, we select the water flow ùëÑ for our sensitivity analysis and stability analysis.
