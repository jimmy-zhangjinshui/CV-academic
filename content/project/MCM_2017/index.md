# Background
> he Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River is one of the larger dams in Africa. Its construction was controversial, and a 2015 report by the Institute of Risk Management
of South Africa included a warning that the dam is in dire need of maintenance. A number of options are available to the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) that might address the situation. Three options in particular are of interest to ZRA:
> * (Option 1) Repairing the existing Kariba Dam,
> * (Option 2) Rebuilding the existing Kariba Dam, or
> * (Option 3) Removing the Kariba Dam and replacing it with a series of ten to twenty smaller dams along the Zambezi River.

# Methodology

## Collecting Geographic Information
We used Google Map to obtain the waterfall and river topography.
