# Background
> he Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River is one of the larger dams in Africa. Its construction was controversial, and a 2015 report by the Institute of Risk Management
of South Africa included a warning that the dam is in dire need of maintenance. A number of options are available to the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) that might address the situation. Three options in particular are of interest to ZRA:
> * (Option 1) Repairing the existing Kariba Dam,
> * (Option 2) Rebuilding the existing Kariba Dam, or
> * (Option 3) Removing the Kariba Dam and replacing it with a series of ten to twenty smaller dams along the Zambezi River.

# Methodology

## Collecting Geographic Information
We used Google Map to obtain the waterfall and river topography.

Then we abstracted the altitude of the river and bank.

## Selecting Sites
Pick the best 100 sites of the dams. 
<img src = "Best100.jpg" width = "70%">
## Deciding the final quantity of dams
We took three factors into consideration to adjust the final number of the dams. 
1. The status of the last dam
2. The critical terrain
3. The utilization of hydropower
