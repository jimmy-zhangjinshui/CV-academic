Mr. Zhang received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Tianjin University in China. He maintained a high GPA of 3.82/4.0 and mastered knowledge of power systems. Also, he was a big fan of mathematics modelling and optimization algorithms. For his graduation project, he did a research on a novel topology of PFC rectifier realizing active power decoupling, which was the beginning of his exploration in Power Electronics.

He chose to pursue a Master in Xi'an Jiaotong University from the year 2018. He has acquired valuable knowledge and skills related to control and design of power electronic systems.

Meanwhile, as a research assistant of IEEE Fellow Prof. Liu Jinjun, he has hitherto conducted a series of studies on high-frequency and high-power-density power converters in the Power Electronics and Renewable Energy Center. His work so far included but not limited to the development of Totem-Pole PFC rectifier, the investigation on the saturation of Powdered Iron Core inductors, the optimization of resonant parameters of LLC resonant converter. 

He has high faith in the application of Wide-Band-Gap devices in the future. Meanwhile, cool technologies like Wireless Power Transfer also attract him very much.
