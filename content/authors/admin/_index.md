Mr. Zhang received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Tianjin University in China. During 4 years there, he maintained an outstanding GPA of 3.82/4.0 and mastered the knowledge related to power systems. Also, he was fascinated with mathematic modelling and optimization algorithms. For his graduation project, he did research on a novel topology of PFC rectifier which can realize active power decoupling. This is the beginning of his adventure in Power Electronics.

He chose to pursue a Master degree in Xi'an Jiaotong University from the year 2018. During this time, he acquired valuable knowledge and skills related to control and design of power electronic systems, obtaining an impressive GPA of 3.9/4.0. Meanwhile, as a research assistant of IEEE Fellow Prof. Liu Jinjun, he has conducted a series of studies on high-frequency compact converters at the Power Electronics and Renewable Energy Center. Results of his work so far mainly include the development of single-phase Totem-Pole PFC rectifier, the investigation on the non-linear characteristics of Powdered Iron Core inductors, and the optimization of resonant tank parameters for LLC converter. 

In the future, he wants to continue his journey in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Specifically, he strongly believes in the development of Wide-Bandgap devices. Besides, he is obsessed with some awesome technologies, such as wireless power transfer and artificial intelligence.
