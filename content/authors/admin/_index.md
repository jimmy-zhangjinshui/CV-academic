Mr. Zhang received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Tianjin University in China. He maintained a high GPA of 3.82/4.0 and mastered knowledge of power systems. Also, he was a big fan of mathematics modelling and optimization algorithms. For his graduation project, he did a research on a novel topology of PFC rectifier realizing active power decoupling, which was the beginning of his exploration in Power Electronics.

He chose to pursue a Master degree in Xi'an Jiaotong University from the year 2018. He acquired valuable knowledge and skills related to control and design of power electronic systems from various lectures and courses.

Meanwhile, as a research assistant of IEEE Fellow Prof. Liu Jinjun, he has hitherto conducted a series of studies on high-frequency and high-power-density power converters at the Power Electronics and Renewable Energy Center. Results of his work so far include but are not limited to the development of Single-Phase Totem-Pole PFC rectifier, the investigation on the non-linear characteristics of Powdered Iron Core inductors, the optimization of resonant tank parameters for LLC converter. 

In the future, he want to continue his journey in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Specifically, he has high faith in the application of Wide-Band-Gap devices in the future. Meanwhile, many cool technologies like Wireless Power Transfer are also very attractive to him.
