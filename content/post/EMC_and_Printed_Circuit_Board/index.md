Discussion about the PCB design and EMC (Electro-Magnetic Compatibility) never stopped. The thing we need to do seems quite simple, find the three elements of the interference: Source, Propagation path, and Load. And then break them down.

Here, this blog would record some essential information from references to help us understand the nature of a good design of PCB. Equations and diagrams are expected. Besides, some resources from Youtube or some forums may help us understand better. 

Meanwhile, since I major in Power Eletronics, the content of this blog might have a closer relationship to it than the others.
