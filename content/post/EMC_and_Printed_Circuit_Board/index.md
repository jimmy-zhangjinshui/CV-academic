Discussion about the PCB design and EMC (Electro-Magnetic Compatibility) never stopped. The thing we need to do seems quite simple, find the three elements of the interference: Source, Propagation path, and Load. And then break them down. Though, the principles are important. You don't want to create a monster with some rigid rules. "The devil is in the detail."

Here, this blog would record some essential information to illustrate the nature of a good design of PCB. Besides, some resources from *Youtube* or some forums may help. 

Meanwhile, since the blogger majored in Power Eletronics, this blog might have a closer relationship to it than the others. Surely, we would also try our best to explain the high-frequency electronics well.

## Overview
In this section, we would give an overview of respectively EMC, PCB and the bond between. 

### Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
- What is Interference?
- 


### Printed Circuit Board
- Structure of the board
- available development softwares
- process of production

### EMC inside PCB

## Special Topics
- Cross talk
- Impedance and signal reflection
